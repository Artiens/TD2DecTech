## Questions
Q1 - Create a torrent containing this image.

Q2 - Now copy the image to a new directory named partition1 and create a torrent of this folder. What do you observe?

The generated torrent file references the folder partition1, and its metadata reflects both the directory structure and the file content.


Q3 - Copy the partition1 folder and then generate the associated torrent. What do you observe?

The generated torrent for partition1_copy will have identical file data and structure but a different hash because the torrent metadata includes the path and potentially timestamp information.
